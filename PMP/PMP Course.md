# 学习 PMP 的目的
- 从现在 8 月到 10 月, 2 个月的时间, 我要完成 AIDC 的项目, 这是一个 project. 这并不是我接触的第一个项目, 但是希望利用这个机会去学习一套项目管理的最佳实践. 并在实践的过程中, 最大话吸收和思考交付交付的方法论. 
- 我的职业生涯从 PMO 开始, 10 年时间做到 IT Manager, 面对的下属, 合作方, Sponsor, Functional Manager, 采购这些, 如何进行沟通. 也算是达到中层管理的一条必经之路吧. 系统的学习之后, 从此在自己的开发和工作中, 逐渐去观察和磨练这部分技能
- 以上两点解释了 why and why now 的问题
- 因为学习编程往往需要整段的时间, 而且难度比较大, 需要专注学习. 但是PMP 可以利用碎片的时间和学习编程之间的休息时间, 睡觉前的时间, 进行调剂学习. 

学习的时间规划, 2 个月, 从 8 月到 9 月底, 10 月头可以才加考试. 不过是线上考试


# PMP Terms
Project
- A temporary endeavor that produces a unique product, service or result
- Temporary in nature and has a definite beginning and ending 和 operation不同
- Can be part of large Program or Portfolio
- 随着项目的推进, 我们对项目中遇到的风险和认知会逐渐增加, 项目的交付难度和风险会逐渐减少Progressively Elaborated

Project Management
- Project management is the applicaiton of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to satisfy project requirements
- 管理项目 50%是在管理人. Project Manager 本质上是 People Management

Program
- 一个 Program 包含多个 project
- 一个 Program 下的多个Project 是存在相互依赖关系的. 这样把这些项目放在一个 program下面去管理才是有意义的

 PMO
 Organizational structure that standardizes the process and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques. 
 Types 分类是要考的
 - Supportive: Support the project manager, such as providing templates, training, or lessons learned from other projects
 - Controlling: Determines the framework or methodology and use of specific forms
 - Directive: Controls the project. PM will be assigned and report to the PMO
 项目管理办公室. 这个部门专门定义项目交付的方法论, 管理工具, 技术, 合规性. 指派项目经理. 分享其他项目中的经验. 使一个企业中的不同的项目, 按照相同的方式去交付. 我们不希望看到的是每个项目经理有独特的交付项目的方式, 这不利于企业内部知识的分享. 如果一个项目经理走了, 别的项目经理无法承接项目. 

Portfolio Management
- A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives
- Portfolio 往往是为战略目标服务的. Strategic business objective  往往是一个企业 3-5 年的长期目标
- Portfolio 可以包含 program 或者 project, 往往设 C suite 的阶层去讨论的. 

Operations Management
- Deal with the ongoing production of goods and/or Service
- Considers the acquisition, development, and utilization of resources that firms need to deliver the goods and services.

Value of Projects
- What value will this project bring to the company upon completion
- Why should we undertake this project
- Money, Brand Reputation, Customer Service, new or Change project or service

Projects enable change 项目造成的变化
- Project can be a vehicle for change in an organization
- Take a company from current state to desired state

Phase and deliverable
一个项目可以分为多个阶段, 但是每个阶段分割的标准, 每个阶段都需要有给客户或者 sponsor认可的交付件, 即 deliverable

Project Life Cycle
- A representation of the phases that a project typically goes through from start to end
- can be either predictive or adaptive

Project Governance
- Framework, functions, and processes that guide a company to create a project. 
- Three pillars
	- Structure
	- People
	- Information 决策的好不好, 取决于能够获取到的信息

Stakeholders: 因为这个项目收到影响的人, 可能是 postive impact 也可能是 negative
- Project manager
- Customer 最重要
- Project Team 项目组成员
- Project Sponsor - Provides resource and support 你的领导
- Functional Manager - Department Manager, generally control resource 往往是控制你 resource 的人. 或者是抢你资源的人, 可能是你的敌人

Project Manager Role
- Initiator: An initiator is someone who takes the first step or proposes an idea or action
- Negotiator: A negotiator is an individual who engages in discussion or formal negotiations to reach mutually agreeable solutions or outcomes. 
- Listener: A listener is someone who pays attention to other's ideas, thoughts, or concerns during conversations or discussions. 
- Coach: A coach is a person who guides and supports individuals or teams in achieving their goals, improving performance, and enhancing their skills
- Working member: A working member refers to an individual who actively participates as a member of a team or group
- Facilitator: A facilitator is someone who manages group processes, discussions, or meetings to ensure effective communication, collaboration, and decision-making.

Milestone vs Task duration
- Milestone: A milestone is a significant event or achievement in a project that marks a key point or completion of a major deliverable
- Task Duration: Task duration refers to the amount of time it takes to complete a specific task or activity within a project. Gantt Chart 甘特图

Project Bosses
- Sponsor 是否接受 deliverable, 是否接受 scope 的变化, 做 desicion feature
	- internal or external 通常是内部的
	- Project Champion
	- Funding the project
	- Make decision
- Program Manager
	- Senior to Project Manager
	- Maybe responsible for several project executed at the same time
	- Maybe used to resolve conflicts in the project

Product vs Project Management
- Product Management
	- Product management encompasses the strategic planning, development, and lifecycle management of a product or service 关注在产品的生命周期, 商业价值的实现, 客户满意度, 面向是的市场
	- It involves understanding market needs, defining product strategy, gathering requirements, and overseeing the product's development, launch, and ongoing optimisation.  产品的需求, 开发, 发布, 优化
	- Product managers are responsible for the overall success of the product, aligning it with business objectives and customer demands
- Project Management
	- Focuses on the successfully execution and delivery of specific projects within a defined scope, timeline, and budget 按照这三个要素去构建项目, 关注在成功执行
	- Project managers are responsible for planning, coordinating, and managing the activities required to achieve project goals. 计划, 调度, 协同, 管理各种动作以实现目标
	- They ensure the project is completed on time, within budget, and according to the specific quality standards.  在验收时做到质控
- Product manager work closely with project managers to translate the product strategy and roadmap into actionable project plans
- Project managers oversee the execution of those plans, ensuring that the product is developed, tested, and delivered according to the defined specifications. 
- While project management is a part of product development, it is just one component 所以产品经理的角色, 往往是比项目经理的地位要高. 在一个产品的生命周期中, 有很多的很多项目

Areas of a project
- Scope
	- Work to be done
- Schedule
	- Time to get the work done
- Cost
	- Budget of the work
- Quality
	- Customer satisfaction of work
- Resources
	- Managing the people and material resources
- Communications 沟通能力, 在合适的时间, 正确的信息
	- All stakeholders get the correct information at the right time
- Risk 体现项目经理的经验
	- Identifying and responding to risk over the lifecycle of the project
- Procurements
	- Acquiring resources from outside the project team
- Stakeholder's engagement 主动汇报, 让大家知道, value communication
	- Keeping all stakeholders active and alert on the project
这些area 中, 最重要的是 Communications 和 engagement. 最需要管理的是 Risk, 所有的动作都有 risk
好的项目经理需要把上述这些 area integrate together and form a well-made plan.

Project Management Approach
- predictive (traditional or waterfall)
- Adaptive (agile or iterative)

Predictive Approach: The predictive approach follows a linear and sequential process
- It involves detailed planning and documentation upfront, with focus on predicting and defining the project scope, objectives, timeline, and deliverables. 
- Extensive upfront planning
- Sequential execution
- Emphasis on control and documentation
- Limited flexibility, limited changes with a well define change control process
对于一开始把项目 scope 定义得非常清楚的项目, 我们使用 Predictive Approach. 这种方法最重要的是 scope, scope 不能改变. 因为一旦改变, 项目则无法交付, 因为整个设计方案, 都可能需要被推到重来. 如果真的要做变更, 一般需要严格的流程审批. 
Adaptive Approach: Focus on flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development
- It embraces change throughout the project and emphasizes continues feedback and improvement
- Iterative and incremental development. Incremental 指交付的软件的功能是不断增加和完善的(Scrum). Iterative 是指刚开始是 prototype, 通过不断重新迭代, 逐渐变成成熟的产品
- Customer collaboration, get feedback from customer. 很重要
- Emphasis on adaptability 
- Self-organizing teams 团队自己做很多的决策, 而不是 project manager, 此时 project manager 转变为servant leader
- The adaptive approach, commonly used in agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban
Hybrid you combine the predictive and adaptive approach

Organizational Structure 
不同的组织架构, Project Manager的权利是不同的
- Functional Organizations PM 的权利最小
	- Structure that groups staff members according to their area of expertise (sales, marketing, constrution, etc). Functional structures require the project team members to report directly to the functional manager
- Matrix Organizations PM 的权利在 middle
	- There are three matrix structure: weak, balanced, and strong. The different structure are reflective of the project manager's authority in relation to the functional manager's authority. Strong Matrix, PM is full time, Weak Matrix, PM is part time
- Project Oriented Organizations. (Projectized) PM 的权利最大
	- Structure where the PM has the greatest amount of authority. The project team is assigned to the project on a full-time basis. When the project is complete, the project team member moves on to other assignments within the organization.
- Hybird
	- Blended type
- Organic
	- Company owner control the resource

Risk vs Issues vs Assumption vs Constraints
- Risk are potential events or situations that may occur in the future and have an impact on the project success  风险可能是好的, 也可能是坏的. 但是不一定发生. Risk 管理有 Risk Register
- Issues refer to problems or challenges that arise during the course of a project. They are typically negative events or circumstances that can hinder progress or impact project objectives.  Issue 总是不好的, 一定是已经发生了的. Issue 管理有 Issue Log
- Assumptions are statements or beliefs that are considered to be true or valid for the purpose of planning and decision-making
- Constrains are limitations or restriction that affect project planning and execution, 比如说施工许可permit

Project Constraints
- Scope
- Schedule
- Cost
- Risk
- Quality
- Resources

Emotional Intelligence 后面有时间, 还需要看看别的书和课程. 记住, 不要和别人争论对错. 言多有失
A good project manager is good to manage people. Manage people, manage emotions of people. Manage the emotion of ourself. 
- Emotional Intelligence (EQ) refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions, both in oneself and in others. 
- It involves being aware of one's own emotions, effectively handling them, empathizing with others, and using emotions to guide thinking and behavior.
- In project management, EQ plays a significant roles 情商在项目管理中非常重要
如果控制不好情绪, 就会引起争吵, upset, 对抗, 事情升级. 我自己的情绪也会影响到他人的情绪. It is how you say it. (怎么说话本身是一种情商的体现). 批评即使是有意义的, 但是会带来对抗的情绪.  你越是批评, 对方越是 defensive 的对抗. 
当 team member 跟你沟通的时候, 往往是 feeling, 表达的是 emotion, 而不一定是问题本身, 你要有能力去识别那些是情绪, 不要尝试去教会他们理性思考(这是父母和老师的事情), 你要做的可能是先安抚对方的情绪, 不要把事情升级, 然然看看能不能理解对方, 和对方共情. 没错, 向下共情也是一种能力. 然后看看在合适的时间, 重新找一个时间来试图解决这个问题
- Relationship Building
- Communication and Conflict Management. Conflict Management 观察对方的语气, 肢体语言, 试图找寻办法, 把对方的情绪拉下来. 如果我们不能理解的对方的 feel, 我们无法把情绪拉下来
- Motivation and influence
- Leadership and Decision Making
- Stakeholders Management

Leadership vs. Management
Management
- Management focuses on task, processes, and operations to ensure efficient execution
- It involves planning, organizing, coordinating, and controlling resources
- Manager have formal authority and responsibility within the organization
- They maintain stability, control, and order, ensuring established processes and procedures are followed. 
- Focus on coordinating and directing task, resources, and processes to achieve predetermined objectives. 
- Management is aim for efficiency, which means cheap and quick, the least of money and how fast it could be done
Manager 的工作是确保部门中的人 follow the procedure of the company. 实现的目标是work is done efficiently
Leadership leader has long term vision 看得非常远. 怎样去培养 vision 呢
- Focuses on inspiring and influence others
- Involves setting direction, motivating and empowering individuals
- They inspire and influence other
- They encourage collaboration, trust, and empowerment

好的项目经理需要知道什么是使用 management, 什么时候用 Leadership. 两个都要会

# Project management principle
Project management principle
- Principles serves as foundational guidelines for strategy, decision making, and problem solving.
- professional standards and methodologies are often based on principles.
- Principles for project management provide guidance for the behavior of people involved in projects

PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
- Principles can, but do not necessarily, reflect morals.
- A code of ethics is related to morals.
- A code of ethics for a profession can be adopted by an individual or profession to establish
expectations for moral conduct. 
- PMI is based on four values:
	◦ Responsibility
	◦ Respect
	◦ Fairness
	◦ Honest

12 Principles
1. Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward 
2. Create a collaborative project team environment 
3. Effectively engage with stakeholders 
4. Focus on value 
5. Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions
6. Demonstrate leadership behaviors
7. Tailor based on context 
8. Build quality into processes and deliverables 
9. Navigate complexity 
10. Optimize risk responses
11. Embrace adaptability and resiliency 
12. Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state

Be A Diligent, Respectful, and Caring Steward
STEWARDSHIP: “The act of taking care of or managing something, for example property, an organization, money or valuable objects.” - act sensibly to carry out actions with integrity, care, and trustworthiness while keeping compliance with internal and external guidelines. They demonstrate a broad commitment to financial, social, and environmental impacts of the projects they support. Stewardship has responsibilities both within and external to the company

Stewardship includes: 
- Integrity
	- Stewards behave honestly and ethically 
- Care
	- Stewards are fiduciaries of the organizational matters in their charge, and they diligently oversee them.
- Trustworthiness 
	- Stewards represent themselves, their roles, their project team, and their authority accurately, both inside and outside of the organization. 
- Compliance 
	- Stewards comply with laws, rules, regulations, and requirements. 
A holistic view of stewardship considers financial, social, technical, and sustainable environmental awareness.

Create a collaborative project team environment 
TEAM 
Projects are done by project teams. 
Project teams are made up of people who have diverse skills, knowledge, and experience. Project teams that work collaboratively can finish a shared objective more effectively and efficiently than individuals working on their own. Project teams work within organizational and professional cultures and guidelines, often establishing their own “local” culture. 
A collaborative project team environment facilitates:
- Alignment with other organizational cultures and guidelines
- Individual and team learning and development, and
- Optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes.

Project Teams will be affected by: 
Team agreements.
- Team agreements represent a set of behavioral parameters and 
- Organizational structures
	- Project teams use, tailor, and implement structures that help Processes. 
- Project teams define processes that enable completion of tasks and work assignments.

- Transparency on roles and responsibilities can improve team cultures. 
- Authority. The order of having the right, within a given context, to make relevant decisions, establish or improve procedures, apply project resources, expend funds, or give approvals. Accountability. The condition of being answerable for an outcome. 
- Accountability is not shared. 
- Responsibility. The condition of being obligated to do or fulfill something. Responsibility can be shared. 
- A diverse project team can develop the project atmosphere by bringing together different perspectives.
- Teams should incorporate practice standards, ethical codes, and other guidelines as part of the professional work within the project team and the organization. 
- A collaborative project team environment promotes the free exchange of information and individual knowledge.

Effectively engage with stakeholders
STAKEHOLDERS Engage stakeholders proactively and to the point needed to contribute to project success and customer satisfaction. Stakeholders impact projects, performance, and outcomes. Project teams work for other stakeholders by engaging with them. Stakeholder engagement proactively improves value delivery

Stakeholders can affect many aspects of a project, including but not limited to:
- Scope/requirements 
- Schedule
- Cost
- Project team 
- Plans
- Outcomes
- Culture
- Benefits realization
- Risk
- Quality
- Success
Identifying, analyzing, and proactively engaging with stakeholders from the start to the end of the project 
Project teams are a group of stakeholders. Consist of defining how, when, how often, and under what situations stakeholders want to be and should be engaged. 
This relies on interpersonal skills, including taking initiative, integrity, honesty, collaboration, respect, empathy, and confidence. 
Engagement helps project teams detect, collect, and evaluate information, data, and opinions. Project teams actively engage other stakeholders throughout the project to minimize potential negative impacts and maximize positive impacts.

Focus on value
VALUE Continually evaluate and adjust project alignment to business objectives and intended benefits and value. 
Value is the ultimate indicator of project success.
Value can be realized throughout the project, at the end of the project, or after the project is complete.
Value, and the benefits that contribute to value, can be defined in quantitative and/or qualitative terms. 
A focus on outcomes allows project teams to support the intended benefits that lead to value creation. 
Project teams evaluate progress and adapt to maximize the expected value.

Includes outcomes from the perspective of the customer or end user, is the ultimate success indicator and driver of projects. 
A business case contains at least these supporting and interrelated elements: ◦
- Business need
- Project justification
- Business strategy 
Value is the worth, importance, or usefulness of something. Value is subjective, in the sense that the same concept can have different values for different people and organizations. 
To support value realization from projects, project teams shift focus from deliverables to the intended outcomes. Doing so allows project teams to deliver on the vision or purpose of the project, rather than simply creating a specific deliverable.

Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions
SYSTEMS THINKING
A system is a set of interacting and interdependent components that function as a unified whole. 
A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity. 
Recognize, evaluate, and respond to the dynamic circumstances within and surrounding the project in a holistic way to positively affect project performance.
Systems thinking entails taking a holistic view of how project parts interact with each other and with external systems. 
Systems are constantly changing, requiring consistent attention to internal and external conditions. 
Being responsive to system interactions allows project teams to leverage positive outcomes.

Project teams should acknowledge this holistic view of a project, seeing the project as a system with its own working parts. 
A project works within other larger systems, and a project deliverable may become part of a larger system to realize benefits. 
As projects unfold, internal and external conditions are continuously changing. A single change can create several impacts 
Systems thinking also applies to how the project team views itself and its interactions within the project system. 
The project system often brings together a diverse project team engaged in working for a common objective.

Demonstrate leadership behaviors
LEADERSHIP 
Demonstrate and adapt leadership behaviors to support individual and team needs.
Effective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes. Any project team member can demonstrate leadership behaviors. 
Leadership is different than authority. 
Effective leaders adapt their style to the situation.
Effective leaders recognize differences in motivation among project team members.
Leaders demonstrate desired behavior in areas of honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct.

On a high-performing project multiple people may exhibit effective leadership skills including the project 
It is important to remember that more conflict and misunderstanding can emerge when too many participants attempt to employ project influence in multiple, misaligned directions. Leadership should not be confused with authority. Authority is the right to exercise power and control individuals. 
It takes leadership to motivate a people toward a common goal, inspire them to align their individual interests in favor of collective effort, and achieve success as a project team rather than as individuals.

Team members develops leadership wisdom by adding or practicing a combination of various skills or techniques, including but not limited to:
- Focusing a project team around agreed goals
- Articulating a motivating vision for the project
- Generating consensus on the best way forward
- Overcoming obstacles to project progress
- Negotiating and resolving conflict
- Adapting communication style and messaging to stakeholders
- Coaching and mentoring fellow project team members
- Having self-awareness of one’s own bias and behaviors 
- Managing and adapting to change during the project

**Projects work best when leaders understand what motivates people.** 
Project teams can flourish when project team members use suitable leadership traits, skills, and characteristics that match the specific needs and expectations of stakeholders.
Effective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes.
By mixing styles and leveraging motivators, any project team member or stakeholder can motivate or influence and in turn grow the project team, regardless of role or position.

Tailor based on context
Each project is unique. 
Design the project development methods based on the needs of the project and its objectives, stakeholders, governance, and the environment. 
Using “just enough” process to accomplish the desired outcome while maximizing value, managing cost, and enhancing speed. 
Project success is based on adapting to the unique context of the project 
Tailoring the method is iterative, and therefore is a continuous process throughout the project. Project teams tailor the proper framework that will enable the flexibility to consistently produce positive outcomes.
Project teams discuss and decide on the delivery approach and resources on a project by-project basis. 
Tailoring the project approach to suit the unique characteristics of the project and its environment 
A tailored project approach can produce benefits, such as: 
- Deeper commitment from project team members
- Reduction in waste in terms of actions or resources
- Customer-oriented focus 
- More efficient use of project resources

Build quality into processes and deliverables
QUALITY 
Quality is about meeting the acceptance criteria for deliverables. 
Project quality is about satisfying stakeholders’ expectations and fulfilling project and product requirements. 
Stakeholders will have to maintain a focus on quality that produces deliverables that meet project objectives and align to the needs set forth by stakeholders. 
Project quality ensures processes are appropriate and as effective as possible.
Quality may have several different dimensions, including but not limited to the following: 
- Performance
- Conformity
- Reliability
- Resilience
- Satisfaction 
- Efficiency
- Sustainability 
Teams measure quality using metrics and acceptance criteria’s. 
The objective is to help ensure that what is delivered meets the objectives of the customer and other relevant stakeholders.

Navigate complexity
COMPLEXITY 
Complexity is the outcome of human behavior, system interactions, uncertainty, and ambiguity. Complexity can arise at any point during the project.
Constantly evaluate and navigate project complexity so that approaches and plans enable the project team to successfully navigate the entire project. 
Complexity can be introduced by events or conditions 
Project teams can stay vigilant in identifying elements of complexity and use a variety of methods to reduce the amount or impact of complexity. 
Project teams often cannot forecast complexity emerging because it is the result of many conditions and events.
Some of the more common sources of complexity are: 
- Human behavior 
- System behavior 
- Uncertainty and ambiguity 
- Technological innovation 
Being vigilant for indications of complexity allows project teams to adapt their approaches and plans to navigate potential disruption to effective project delivery.

Optimize risk responses
A risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect on one or more objectives.
Risks can be positive (opportunities) or negative (threats). 
Project teams seek to maximize positive risks (opportunities) and decrease exposure to negative risks (threats). 
Constantly evaluate exposure to risk, both opportunities and threats, to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts to the project and its outcomes. 
Risks are addressed continually throughout the project.
Risk responses should be: 
- Appropriate for the significance of the risk
- Cost effective,
- Realistic within the project context, 
- Agreed to by relevant stakeholders, and
- Owned by a responsible person. 
Project team members engage with relevant stakeholders to understand their risk appetite and risk thresholds. 
An organization’s risk attitude, appetite, and threshold influence how risk is addressed.

Embrace adaptability and resiliency
Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions. 
Resiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and to recover quickly from a setback or failure. 
Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization’s and project team’s approaches 
A focus on outcomes rather than outputs facilitates adaptability. 
A project rarely performs exactly as initially planned. 
Projects are influenced by internal and external factors—new requirements, issues, stakeholder influences, among other factors—which exist in a system of interactions.

In a project environment, capabilities that support adaptability and resilience include:
- Short feedback loops to adapt quickly; 
- Continuous learning and improvement;
- Regular inspection and adaptation 
- Open and transparent planning that engages stakeholders
- Small-scale prototypes and experiments
- Open organizational conversations
- Diverse project teams with broad skill sets, cultures, and experience
- Understanding from past learning

Building adaptability and resiliency in a project keeps project teams on track to the desired outcome when internal and external factors change, and it helps them recover from setbacks. These features also help project teams learn and improve so that they can quickly recover from failures or setbacks and continue making progress toward delivering value.

Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state
CHANGE 
Prepare those impacted for the acceptance to go from the current state to the intended future state created by the project output. 
A structured approach will helps individuals, groups, and the organization transition from the current state to a future desired state. 
Change can originate from internal influences or external sources.
Enabling change can be challenging as not all stakeholders embrace change. 
Attempting too much change in a short time can lead to change fatigue and/or resistance. Stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches assist in change adoption.

Remaining relevant in today’s business environment is a fundamental challenge for all organizations. 
Change in an organization can originate from internal sources and external sources. 
Enabling change in an organization can be challenging. 
Effective change management uses a motivational strategy rather than a forceful one. 
Knowing and addressing the needs of stakeholders to embrace change throughout the project life cycle helps to integrate the resulting change in the project work, making a successful outcome more likely.
